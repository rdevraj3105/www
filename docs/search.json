Outside of academics, I’m involved in undergraduate research with the  Space Systems Optimization Group (SSOG)  where I focus on involving space logistics modeling, optimization, and Mars rover surface routing. I’m also part of a variety of campus organizations, such as the 180 Degrees Consulting club, the GT Venture Capital Club, and intramural basketball."

    "text": "This capstone project was the culmination of the CMU SURE 2024 Bridges to Healthcare Technology Program in partnership with UnitedHealth Group. Our project was focused on the impact of adult health-related practices on juvenile health outcomes. We primarly analyzed the impact of adult health behaviors like drinking, smoking, and insufficient sleep on the child mortality rate and low birthweight percentage on a county level. Our modeling consisted of regularization techniques (lasso and ridge regression) and linear regression for predicting low birthweight as well as a decision tree to predict outcomes of child mortality."
